# Instructions

Your job is to translate RNA sequences into proteins.

RNA strands are made up of three-nucleotide sequences called **codons**.
Each codon translates to an **amino acid**.
When joined together, those amino acids make a protein.

In the real world, there are 64 codons, which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids.
However, for this exercise, you’ll only use a few of the possible 64.
They are listed below:

| Codon              | Amino Acid    |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| AUG                | Methionine    |
| UUU, UUC           | Phenylalanine |
| UUA, UUG           | Leucine       |
| UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG | Serine        |
| UAU, UAC           | Tyrosine      |
| UGU, UGC           | Cysteine      |
| UGG                | Tryptophan    |
| UAA, UAG, UGA      | STOP          |

For example, the RNA string “AUGUUUUCU” has three codons: “AUG”, “UUU” and “UCU”.
These map to Methionine, Phenylalanine, and Serine.

## “STOP” Codons

You’ll note from the table above that there are three **“STOP” codons**.
If you encounter any of these codons, ignore the rest of the sequence — the protein is complete.

For example, “AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG” contains a STOP codon (“UAA”).
Once we reach that point, we stop processing.
We therefore only consider the part before it (i.e. “AUGUUUUCU”), not any further codons after it (i.e. “AUG”).
